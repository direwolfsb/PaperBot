# PaperBot
Developed a Streamlit-based chatbot application called 'Paperbot' that interacts with users to retrieve and generate responses using a context-aware, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The app integrates with OpenAI's language model, processes website content, and maintains conversation history for contextual accuracy.
