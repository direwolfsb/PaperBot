# Paperbot: Chat with Websites

This project, Paperbot, is an interactive application that allows users to chat with websites using a conversational interface. The application is built using Streamlit and integrates with OpenAI's language model to provide intelligent responses based on content extracted from a given website. The primary objective of this project is to create a seamless experience where users can ask questions related to a website's content and receive accurate, context-aware answers.

## Key Features

The application uses LangChain components to load and process documents from a website. By specifying a URL, Paperbot retrieves the website's content, splits it into manageable chunks, and then stores these chunks in a vector store using embeddings generated by OpenAI. This vector store serves as the foundation for a context-aware retrieval system that enhances the accuracy of the bot's responses. A significant aspect of this project is the creation of a history-aware retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chain, which enables the bot to provide responses that are not only relevant to the user's query but also informed by the conversation's history. This feature ensures a more natural and coherent interaction, similar to how humans engage in a dialogue.

Paperbot is designed to be user-friendly and easy to deploy. The Streamlit interface allows users to interact with the bot directly from a web browser. Users can input a website URL in the sidebar, and the application will automatically load the content, ready for interaction. The chat interface within Streamlit facilitates smooth communication, where users can type their queries, and the bot responds in real-time. The project also includes error handling for scenarios where the website URL is missing or incorrectly formatted, ensuring a robust user experience.

The application has been deployed on Amazon EC2, making it accessible online for testing and use. By leveraging the power of cloud computing, Paperbot is capable of handling multiple users simultaneously while maintaining performance and response accuracy. This deployment in a scalable environment like Amazon EC2 ensures that the application can be used in various real-world scenarios, from customer support chatbots to educational tools.

Overall, Paperbot demonstrates how modern NLP techniques can be applied to create interactive and intelligent applications. Its ability to chat with websites opens up new possibilities for how we interact with online content, making it a valuable tool for both developers and users.
