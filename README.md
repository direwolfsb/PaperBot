<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6d1ba77-8df1-4f60-ac53-447621f7e98c" width="500"/>
## Overview

Paperbot is an innovative interactive application that allows users to chat with websites using a conversational interface. By leveraging the power of Streamlit and OpenAI's language model, Paperbot provides intelligent, context-aware responses based on content extracted from specified websites. The primary objective is to create a seamless user experience where questions related to a website's content are answered accurately and meaningfully, mimicking a natural conversation.

The application is live and accessible at [https://paperbot-mjk4jthjyeiglyszdhnmsq.streamlit.app/](https://paperbot-mjk4jthjyeiglyszdhnmsq.streamlit.app/).

## Key Features

- **Conversational Interface:** Users can chat with websites using a natural language interface, receiving context-aware answers.
- **Streamlit Integration:** The application is built using Streamlit, making it easy to deploy and accessible from any web browser.
- **LangChain Components:** Utilizes LangChain components to load, split, and process website content efficiently.
- **Vector Store:** Embeddings generated by OpenAI are stored in a vector store, enhancing the accuracy of responses by enabling context-aware retrieval.
- **History-Aware Retrieval:** The bot provides responses informed by the conversation's history, ensuring coherence and relevance.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive chat interface within Streamlit for smooth communication.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paperbot.git
cd paperbot
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### OpenAI API Key

Ensure you have an OpenAI API key. You can obtain one by signing up on the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com). Once you have the API key, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key as follows:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Usage

### Running the Application Locally

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with Paperbot.

### Accessing the Deployed Application

Paperbot is also deployed on Streamlit and can be accessed online using the following link:

[https://paperbot-mjk4jthjyeiglyszdhnmsq.streamlit.app/](https://paperbot-mjk4jthjyeiglyszdhnmsq.streamlit.app/)

### Using the Chat Interface

1. **Enter a Website URL:** In the sidebar, input the URL of the website you wish to chat with.
2. **Ask Questions:** Type your questions in the chat interface, and the bot will respond in real-time.
3. **View Responses:** The bot provides context-aware answers based on the website's content.

## How It Works

### Document Loading

Paperbot uses LangChain components to load the content from the specified website. The content is then split into manageable chunks for efficient processing and storage.

### Vector Store Creation

Once the content is split, embeddings are generated using OpenAI's language model. These embeddings are stored in a vector store, which serves as the foundation for retrieving relevant information based on user queries.

### Conversation Flow

Paperbot employs a history-aware retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chain. This feature ensures that the bot's responses are not only relevant to the current query but also informed by the history of the conversation, resulting in a more natural and coherent dialogue.

## Deployment

Paperbot is deployed on Streamlit and can be accessed through the following link:

[https://paperbot-mjk4jthjyeiglyszdhnmsq.streamlit.app/](https://paperbot-mjk4jthjyeiglyszdhnmsq.streamlit.app/)

This deployment ensures that the application is easily accessible online for testing and use.

## Error Handling

Paperbot includes error handling for scenarios such as missing or incorrectly formatted URLs. If an error occurs, the application provides a user-friendly message guiding the user to correct the issue.

### Common Errors

- **Invalid URL:** If the provided URL is invalid, the application will notify the user and prompt them to enter a valid URL.
- **Empty Response:** If the website's content cannot be retrieved, the application will inform the user and suggest checking the website's accessibility.
